}
***
## Question 7

`Print out numbers: 31, 35, 40 to 60.`

for num in 20...150 where num == 31 || num == 35 && || (num > 39 && num <= 60) {
print(num) 
}

***
## Question 11

Without using Xcode, how many times will the loop below run?  Explain why.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 3) {
    i += 1
}

// infinite 
```

***
## Question 12

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing when i reaches 9.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i > 9) {
   i += 1 
}

```

***
## Question 13

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times.

```swift
var i = 5

while (i <= 1000) {
    i += 1
}
```

***
## Question 14

Change the code below to make the loop stop executing after it has run 1,000 times and also make it print out the current value of i **only if i is an even number.**

```swift
var i = 5

while (i <= 1000) {
if i % 2 == 0 {
print(i)
i += 1
}
}
```

***
## Question 15

What's the difference in syntax between the following two while loops?  Will their outputs be different?  Explain why or why not.

```swift
var i = 1
//loop one
while i <= 10 {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
}

i = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10

//loop two
var i = 1

repeat {
    print("i = \(i)")
    i += 1
} while i <= 10

i was declared after print therefore it woudlnt compile 

```

# Bonus =)

***
## Question 1

What's the difference between `break` and `continue`?  Give an example that demonstrates their differences.

break - this would stop the loop

continue - this would continue the loop 

for sec in 1...10 {
    if sec > 10 {
        continue
    } else if sec == 9 {
        break
    } else {
        print(sec)
    }
}

***
## Question 2

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        continue
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[]1
[]2
[]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

1,2,3,8,9,10

***
## Question 3

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print? Select all that apply.

```swift
for i in 1...10 {
    if (i >= 4 && i <= 7){
        break
    }
    print(i)
}
```

[]1
[]2
[]3
[]4
[]5
[]6
[]7
[]8
[]9
[]10

4,5,6,7

***
## Question 4

Without using Xcode, what will the loop below print?  Explain below.

```swift
outerloop: for x in 1...3 {
    innerloop: for y in 1...3 {
        if y == 2{
            continue outerloop
        }
        print("x = \(x), y = \(y)")
    }
}

```

***
## Question 5

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 6

Write code that prints out all the points in the area bounded by (0,0), (10,0), (0,10) and (10,10) **where** the difference of x and y is at least 5, and x and y are both integers.

***
## Question 7

Print the first `N` square numbers. A **square number**, also called perfect square, is an integer that is obtained by squaring some other integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself (ex. 1 = 1*1, 4 = 2 * 2, 9 = 3* 3 …).

Example:
Input: `var N = 5`

Output:
```swift

var N = 5 
var squareNumber = N * N 
print(N)

1
4
9
16
25
```

***
## Question 8

Given an integer N draw a square of N x N asterisks. Look at the examples.

Example 1:
Input: `var N = 2`

Output:
```swift

var N = 2
for _ in 1...N {
    for _ in 1...N {
        print("*", terminator: "")
    }
    print("")
}
**
**
```

Example 2:
Input: `var N = 3`

Output:
```swift

var N = 3
for _ in 1...N {
    for _ in 1...N {
        print("*", terminator: "")
    }
    print("")
}
***

```

Hint 1
Try printing a single line of * first.

Hint 2
You can use print("") to print an empty line.
